This is a Delphi library to support FaceBook applications. [FaceBook applications](http://developers.facebook.com/get_started.php) are web-server applications which both call and are called by the [FaceBook Platform](http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php) , via a REST web-service technology.

CAVEAT: This project is still very much a work in progress. If you have come to this
web-site to use the code, watch this space - We're not ready yet. If you have come to
this web-site as a developer interested in the subject, please jump on board and
contribute.

The library is derived from a Delphi interpretation of the PHP client library supplied by FaceBook, but extended to empower the FaceBook developer with a Delphi-friendly programatic interface.

Versions supported are:
  1. Delphi 7, Delphi 2005, Delphi 2006/2007;
  1. Apache 2.2.X;
  1. Apache hosted on win32 o/s (XP/Server2000 onwards).

Possibly in future, we will support kylix/linux.
